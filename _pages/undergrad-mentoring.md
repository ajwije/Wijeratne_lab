## Goals

The Wijeratne lab is a research lab that studies plant-microbe interactions. We are interested in how plants defend themselves against pathogens, and how pathogens overcome these defenses. We are also interested in how these interactions can be manipulated to improve crop yields.

We are committed to providing undergraduate students with a research experience that will help them develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their future careers. We offer students the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects, to learn from experienced scientists, and to gain hands-on experience in the laboratory.

We believe that undergraduate research is an essential part of a well-rounded education, and we are committed to providing students with the opportunity to participate in this important work.

## Introduction

This mentoring compact outlines the expectations and responsibilities of both the student and the mentor in the Wijeratne lab. It is important that both parties read and understand this document before the start of the research experience.
