<u>Graduate Students</u>

I am currently recruiting new Graduate students through [UandI-DEECoDE program](https://www.astate.edu/uandideecode). 


**What is UandI-DEECoDE:** Pronounced “You and I Decode,” is A-State’s inaugural National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT). The acronym stands for Understanding Invasion and Disease Ecology and Evolution through Computational Data Education. This training program is designed for funded trainees, all of whom are doctoral students, as well as affiliate trainees interested in exploring the intersection of invasion biology, disease ecology, and advanced computation. It is intended for students seeking to further their education and prepare for a range of scientific careers.

For <u>Undergraduates</u>, <u>Internships</u>, <u>Sabbaticals</u>, <u>Staff</u> and other job types, please directly [send an email to PI Wijeratne](mailto:awijeratne@astate.edu).
