Dr. Wijeratne has taught a variety of courses. Most of these courses focus on molecular biology and bioinformatics.  Dr. Wijeratne integrate active, inquiry-based learning into the classroom. Below are list of courses:

-  **Bioinformatics and Applications** I developed this course to introduce biology students to the basics of biological data analysis. I have included novel techniques that help students to understand new developments. With the help of IT person Joe Burleson, we were able to host a software management server to integrate different bioinformatic tools at A-State [Galaxy](https://orpheus.cs.astate.edu/). Developed online [tutorial for data analysis](https://2017-spring-bioinfo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
